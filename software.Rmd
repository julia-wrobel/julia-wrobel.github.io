## `registr`

`R` software for registering exponential family functional data. Instructions for download and use available on [GitHub](https://github.com/julia-wrobel/registr).


## `refund.shiny`

I developed the `refund.shiny` package with [Jeff Goldsmith](http://jeffgoldsmith.com/).  ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/refund.shiny/index.html); [GitHub](https://github.com/refunders/refund.shiny); [paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sta4.109/abstract)). 

Through the `plot_shiny()` function, this package produces interactive graphics for several of the most common functional data analyses:

* Functional principal components analysis
* Multilevel and time-varying functional principal components analysis
* Function-on-scalar regression
* Functional linear concurrent regression

This package is closely aligned with the `refund` package: analyses are conducted using functions in `refund` and return objects that can be plotted using `refund.shiny::plot_shiny()`.

## `refund`

I'm currently a maintainer of the `refund` package ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/refund/index.html); [GitHub](https://github.com/refunders/refund)). I've contributed the following function to the package as well.

* `mfpca.sc()` for multilevel functional principal components analysis


## GitHub Packages

* [`mica`](https://github.com/julia-wrobel/mica): **M**ulti **I**mage **C**DF **A**lignment, a package for within-subject intensity normalization of structural MRI data.
* [`depthTests`](https://github.com/julia-wrobel/depthTests), a package developed with [Sara Lopez-Pintado](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/directory/sara-lopez-pintado/) for conducting nonparametric hypothesis tests based on multivariate band depth.
