### Assistant Professor of Biostatistics
### University of Colorado Denver

<br><img src="images/julia3.jpg" alt="julia" style="width:25%"><br>

I obtained a BA in chemistry from [Swarthmore College](http://www.swarthmore.edu/) in 2010 and a PhD in biostatistics from [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics) in 2019. My dissertation was advised by [Jeff Goldsmith](http://jeffgoldsmith.com/) and focused on methods for analyzing and visualizing functional data, with applications in wearable devices, structural MRI, and neurobiology. I joined the Colorado School of Public Health as an assistant professor in 2019.
